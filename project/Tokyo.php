      <h1>Old Edo <span>Asakusa</span></h1>
      <p>
        Asakusa is one of my favorite spots. "Sensoji Temple" in Asakusa is a very popular tourist spot. After passing through the famous Kaminarimon Gate, you can see the sight of Nakamise Street, which is crowded with shops on both sides, leading to Sensoji Temple. Walking into the temple, its solemn and solemn architecture will definitely amaze you.

      <h1>Mount <span>Fuji</span></h1>
      <p>
        Fujisan, as it is known in Japan, is located on Japan's largest island, Honshu. Mt.Fuji is often depicted in art, literature, and religion as the most perfect volcanic cone. Mt. Fuji is the only famous high-elevation mountain not to be part of a larger mountain range. By itself, it is magnificent. Unlike other famous high-elevation mountains in the world, Mt. Fuji is not part of a large mountain range. It stands alone, in all its magnificence.
