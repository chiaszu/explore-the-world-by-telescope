      <h1>About <span>Hokkaido</span></h1>
      <p>
        Hokkaido is the northernmost administrative region in Japan. Due to its late development, the natural environment has not been destroyed by humans. The original natural features are still preserved. It can be said to be Japan's most tourist-worthy natural resort.

      <h1>Lavender <span>in Hokkaido</span></h1>
      <p>
        Speaking of Hokkaido’s summer, you will definitely think of the vast flower fields. The lavender field of Tomita Farm has the reputation of Eastern Provence. The peak of the lavender blooming period is about mid-to-late July. Those who plan to come to appreciate this vast purple blanket can choose Junes and come between late and early August.
